#
# Brings a fresh session VM up to "can actually work on this repository": a running
# Docker daemon, and the dev environment `make setup` builds.
#
# Docker: the environment cache is a filesystem snapshot. It carries the images that
# scripts/cloud-setup.sh pulled, but not the daemon that pulled them, so every session
# starts with dockerd absent -- and PID 1 on the session VM is a Firecracker init shim
# rather than systemd, so there is no service manager to start it. Without this hook,
# scripts/stack.sh up and both ephemeral tiers fail in every session after the first.
#
# The dev environment: .venv lives inside the repository, and the repository is cloned
# fresh for every session, so no snapshot can carry it -- it is built here or it does
# not exist. Synchronous on purpose: about a minute of session start, and nothing in the
# session runs before its tools exist.
#
# The same Docker start logic lives in scripts/cloud-setup.sh. The duplication is
# forced: that script is fetched standalone by the environment's bootstrap, before the
# repository exists on disk, so it cannot source anything from here.
#
# Local sessions exit at the first line: CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE is "true" only inside a
# cloud session VM. Ported from the sibling kibana-py repository, where it runs in
# every cloud session.
